## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, **do not disclose any details in public issues or pull requests**.

Please report potential security problems **exclusively via email**:

If you accidentally opened a public issue first, remove all details and leave a brief note, such as: “Security report sent via email.”*

## Scope
